More often than any other factor, headcount growth kills companies.

The assumption of the status quo: Groups of people have advantage over individuals because they can do more work with better insights and fewer failures.

There are a ton of assumptions baked into this supposition.
- Everyone is working to a common goal.
- All individuals have input.
- Disagreements are raised and resolved to the benefit of the goal.
- Folks aren't blocking each other's work.

These assumptions ring less-and-less true as a group grows.
We're not wired to have the trust needed to fulfill them at scale.
We can subscribe to a rule of law which forces them to be true, but we balk at those stricturesâ€”critique of _Holacracy_ and Bridgewater's _Radical Transparency_ makes that abundantly clear. 

Rather than trying to solve the problem, let's [dissolve](https://squiretothegiants.wordpress.com/2016/06/16/so-you-think-youve-got-a-problem/) it instead.
Let's not try to tightly align massive groups of people.

### Option 1: Stay small.
If we can't get the scaling we want out of a large group of people, what do we gain by having it?
I'd argue, a headache.

Take a cold, hard think about what your _needs_ are.
Are you covering up problems with more bodies?
Why are you doing the work you're doing today?
Can you drop some, most, or all of it?

### Option 2: Allow a huge degree of autonomy around a vision.
Ok, you've got a big, nasty problem.
It's completely inconceivable that you're get traction with a small group, cool.

Are you treating loosely coupled problems as a tightly coupled one?
Could you design interfaces between your problems and let their insides be black boxes labled _Magic_ ?
There are certainly problems that can't be solved this way, but I find that those are usually the ones which are sociological in nature. IE) Caused by overly large groups of people.

### Option n: `<Insert Option Here>`
Obviously this isn't an exhaustative list or a true dichotomy.
I write down these two because they're the path I rarely see travelled.
Companies like Basecamp and Haier are showing how much can be done pursuing alternate strategies.
I hope that we take their lessons to heart. Just because something is _normal_ doesn't mean it's _right_.
Solutions need to be fitted to their context. Design can dissolve problems or completely prevent their formation.

Everything is a trade-off because nothing stands in isolation.
We need to acknowledge the rich, unpredictable ecosystems that are our socio-technical workplaces.
Often that means giving up the illusion of control.
