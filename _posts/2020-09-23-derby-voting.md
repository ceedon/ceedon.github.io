In this COVID'y world, I find I lack feedback I'm accustomed to while facilitating.
A small example of this is the natural reinforcement that occur as folks see others inspect and vote on cards when running LeanCoffees.

As a result, I've been doing something I call Derby voting.
Folks create cards as usual, then they put them into a vertical line.
We cover a synopsis of each topic then open up for voting.

Voting is simple.
Everyone votes concurrently.
You drag the card down the course on tick for each vote you want to cast.
On tools like Miro, Mural, etc. the visual indication of an individual' pointer provides enough of a clue to prevent tugs of war around cards.
The result is an interesting "race" of topics to the fore.
Added bonus for the facilitator: the cards are naturally stack ranked once you compress the columns vertically.
