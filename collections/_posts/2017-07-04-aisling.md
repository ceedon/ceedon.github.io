Towards the end of the lore-crafting [Microscope](http://www.lamemage.com/microscope/) session, it became apparent that a repository of information about the world would be incredibly beneficial for continuity.
That repo will live here. It's public, but hopefully unfound.

It's extremely unlikely that I'll atively share the whole with my players, but I will certainly source it to provide information gradients across the characters.
This idea is straight-up stolen from [an idea shared](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/6fjyfg/dming5e_using_cards_to_give_players_information/) on [the DnD subReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD) that I thought was an elegant way to generate some intrigue and player engagement.

First step is to figure out the way all of this will get stitched together. I'm going to do so manually for now, but maybe this morphs into a hugo wiki script. We'll see.
