So now that I'm comfortable with Stuttgart's public transit system, it's time to go.

I'm catching a train to Cologne and my first *real* airbnb experience—never seeing or speaking to your host disqualifies my previous one, amirite? I'm really looking forward to it. Hopefully my host will be as outgoing as she comes across and I might have her+her SO's company while exploring. The more the merrier. My one gripe is being alone the majority of the time. So much to see and talk about, but no one to do it with. *womp womp*

The differences in culture are pretty interesting. In many ways it feels like progress is striding forward much more steadfastly in Germany; in others, it feels like it stopped some time ago. I seems like it would be hard to ignore so much accumulated, conventional wisdom. This can be a huge hinderance to radical progress. It also generates a society with virtually no crime and fabled efficiency. Different. Better in some ways. Worse in others. Life.

Tübingen had the feel of an American college town. It's a wellspring of new ideas. That said, it looks much like it must have in medieval times. The weight of history seems like it would be a burden in that environment.

Köln promises to be different again. TBD!
