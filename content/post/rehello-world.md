A new incarnation of a blog, a vacation in Europe, a sea-change in work and life upon return: this post is the herald of all of these things.

## The blog

I've been writing an increasing amount on paper, so let's do the Interwebs too! Do I have anything groundbreaking to say? Almost certainly not, but maybe some of you can learn from my struggles be they human or technical in nature.

### What to expect
Yeah, so...

I don't want to hold myself to any goals here. I find that makes me more likely to table-flip and return to my (farcical) quest for domination in the [League](http://na.leagueoflegends.com).

Content-wise, it's probably going to be a bunch of links, photos, and laughable attempts at side projects. Maybe I write about a new album I love, maybe I weigh in on legislative concerns, or maybe it's all cat gifs all the time. Who can really say.

## Europe
I'm writing this whilst on a plane racing towards a layover in London that will (presumably) be rewarded with a flight to Stuttgart. That's *about* all I know. I fly to NYC from Stuttgart by way of London on the 1st of February. There's a conference in Amsterdam somewhere in there. All very hazy. Lodging has been secured for a couple of days once I'm on the ground in Germany, but whim will dictate the rest. You get to follow along with me as that happens. Lucky you! ^^

I can assure you of pictures between now and February 9th. Some of food. Some of architecture. God willing, most of beer.

## Oh, life...
When I get back home, I'll have a new boss, a new primary focus at work, and limited time to find a new place to live sans-roommate-and-canine-companion. I can't imagine that being devoid of things to write about or at least more pictures of booze.

I'm also going to jump back onto the keto bandwagon. I'll cordon that stuff off from the main page, but if you want to follow along, there will be a category filled will  overwrought prose on the finer points of bacon weaving. This may make you a better person. It will certainly endear you to a large portion of my (alleged) audience. Maybe a My Drunk Kitchen clone is in order; though, that way leads ruin. TBD
