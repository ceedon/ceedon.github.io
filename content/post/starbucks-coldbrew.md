It's coldbrew with their beans. Surprising, I know.

Low acidity. Full bodied. No floral notes. Acrid even to my tastes.

Almost exactly what you would expect. Homogenization 4tW?

They steep for 12 hours. The beans are a blend specifically for this use. _/shrug_
They leave the result as concentrate, so you get to pick the viscosity.


Honestly, a decent cup of coffee if you want your choice of strength virtually anywhere and quickly.
