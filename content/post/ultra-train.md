I was promised connectivity. Promised. *squints angrily* [You lied to me.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1fnsffCs8E#t=19)

TIL: Building docker images that pull from Github without a connection is _hard_. We shall agree not to speak of gems.

It's amazing to me that a country this densely populated can have SO MUCH empty space.

It's "urbanized"—by which I mean people live in cities—but not like you think. It tends to be little pockets of civilization. Small towns super close to each other. It works because the infrastructure is so good. You can get pretty much anywhere by train *(without Wifi)*.

I'm riding through snowy fields atm. In a couple of minutes, I'll be back in a large city. Two minutes after that? You guessed it! Fields again.

Turns out, if you leave arable land around cities, they can feed themselves. Moreover, everything arrives fresh and with a minimal footprint. Ridiculous, I know.
