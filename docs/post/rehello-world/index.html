<p>A new incarnation of a blog, a vacation in Europe, a sea-change in work and life upon return: this post is the herald of all of these things.</p>

<h2 id="the-blog">The blog</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing an increasing amount on paper, so let&rsquo;s do the Interwebs too! Do I have anything groundbreaking to say? Almost certainly not, but maybe some of you can learn from my struggles be they human or technical in nature.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect">What to expect</h3>

<p>Yeah, so&hellip;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to hold myself to any goals here. I find that makes me more likely to table-flip and return to my (farcical) quest for domination in the <a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com">League</a>.</p>

<p>Content-wise, it&rsquo;s probably going to be a bunch of links, photos, and laughable attempts at side projects. Maybe I write about a new album I love, maybe I weigh in on legislative concerns, or maybe it&rsquo;s all cat gifs all the time. Who can really say.</p>

<h2 id="europe">Europe</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m writing this whilst on a plane racing towards a layover in London that will (presumably) be rewarded with a flight to Stuttgart. That&rsquo;s <em>about</em> all I know. I fly to NYC from Stuttgart by way of London on the 1st of February. There&rsquo;s a conference in Amsterdam somewhere in there. All very hazy. Lodging has been secured for a couple of days once I&rsquo;m on the ground in Germany, but whim will dictate the rest. You get to follow along with me as that happens. Lucky you! ^^</p>

<p>I can assure you of pictures between now and February 9th. Some of food. Some of architecture. God willing, most of beer.</p>

<h2 id="oh-life">Oh, life&hellip;</h2>

<p>When I get back home, I&rsquo;ll have a new boss, a new primary focus at work, and limited time to find a new place to live sans-roommate-and-canine-companion. I can&rsquo;t imagine that being devoid of things to write about or at least more pictures of booze.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also going to jump back onto the keto bandwagon. I&rsquo;ll cordon that stuff off from the main page, but if you want to follow along, there will be a category filled will  overwrought prose on the finer points of bacon weaving. This may make you a better person. It will certainly endear you to a large portion of my (alleged) audience. Maybe a My Drunk Kitchen clone is in order; though, that way leads ruin. TBD</p>
