    <p>Towards the end of the lore-crafting <a href="http://www.lamemage.com/microscope/">Microscope</a> session, it became apparent that a repository of information about the world would be incredibly beneficial for continuity.
That repo will live here. It&rsquo;s public, but hopefully unfound.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s extremely unlikely that I&rsquo;ll atively share the whole with my players, but I will certainly source it to provide information gradients across the characters.
This idea is straight-up stolen from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/6fjyfg/dming5e_using_cards_to_give_players_information/">an idea shared</a> on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD">the DnD subReddit</a> that I thought was an elegant way to generate some intrigue and player engagement.</p>

<p>First step is to figure out the way all of this will get stitched together. I&rsquo;m going to do so manually for now, but maybe this morphs into a hugo wiki script. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

        Morning

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">2016-09-19, a Monday</span>

    <p>This won&rsquo;t be literary gold, but I&rsquo;m writing it down. Something about morning makes it easier to do so. Maybe it&rsquo;s that I haven&rsquo;t had time to spend too much time inside my head since returning from the clouds of dream. <em>Note to self: check w/ Morpheus.</em></p>

<p>Early morning and late night share so much. The ones I&rsquo;m speaking to are quiet, solitary things&mdash;free from the myriad stimulae of life&mdash;when you are left alone to ponder. These brief periods are good for the soul in a way that simply taking time during the day can&rsquo;t match. Maybe it&rsquo;s simple biology, and circadian rythms can explain it all away. The cause doesn&rsquo;t matter much. What does is the differences between these dawning, dusky stretches.</p>

<p>Morning seems so pregnant with hope, possibilities, and promise. To continue the cliches, it&rsquo;s a time for new beginnings. A time when nothing in our daily lives has been given the opportunity to chain us and limit posibility.</p>

<p>Nights. Nights are more bracing. They are times for reflection on the existent. On the bound possibility that is our knowledge and resources and environment. They are times of wanton productivity, but it&rsquo;s less a function of hope and more of desperation. There is so little time to achieve what we&rsquo;re capable of building.</p>

<p>Ultimately it&rsquo;s abundance contrasted with scarcity. Both are motivators, but the qualities of the products differ wildly. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about these states of mind pretty much constantly as I&rsquo;ve been trying to find a new job. More to come on that.</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s the point? I&rsquo;m not sure there is one, to be honest. Does there need to be? Sometimes all we need is to start.</p>

    <p>It&rsquo;s coldbrew with their beans. Surprising, I know.</p>

<p>Low acidity. Full bodied. No floral notes. Acrid even to my tastes.</p>

<p>Almost exactly what you would expect. Homogenization 4tW?</p>

<p>They steep for 12 hours. The beans are a blend specifically for this use. <em>/shrug</em>
They leave the result as concentrate, so you get to pick the viscosity.</p>

<p>Honestly, a decent cup of coffee if you want your choice of strength virtually anywhere and quickly.</p>

        So long, Stuttgart!

    <span class="post-date">2015-01-24, a Saturday</span>

    <p>So now that I&rsquo;m comfortable with Stuttgart&rsquo;s public transit system, it&rsquo;s time to go.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m catching a train to Cologne and my first <em>real</em> airbnb experience—never seeing or speaking to your host disqualifies my previous one, amirite? I&rsquo;m really looking forward to it. Hopefully my host will be as outgoing as she comes across and I might have her+her SO&rsquo;s company while exploring. The more the merrier. My one gripe is being alone the majority of the time. So much to see and talk about, but no one to do it with. <em>womp womp</em></p>

<p>The differences in culture are pretty interesting. In many ways it feels like progress is striding forward much more steadfastly in Germany; in others, it feels like it stopped some time ago. I seems like it would be hard to ignore so much accumulated, conventional wisdom. This can be a huge hinderance to radical progress. It also generates a society with virtually no crime and fabled efficiency. Different. Better in some ways. Worse in others. Life.</p>

<p>Tübingen had the feel of an American college town. It&rsquo;s a wellspring of new ideas. That said, it looks much like it must have in medieval times. The weight of history seems like it would be a burden in that environment.</p>

<p>Köln promises to be different again. TBD!</p>

    <p>I was promised connectivity. Promised. <em>squints angrily</em> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1fnsffCs8E#t=19">You lied to me.</a></p>

<p>TIL: Building docker images that pull from Github without a connection is <em>hard</em>. We shall agree not to speak of gems.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s amazing to me that a country this densely populated can have SO MUCH empty space.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s &ldquo;urbanized&rdquo;—by which I mean people live in cities—but not like you think. It tends to be little pockets of civilization. Small towns super close to each other. It works because the infrastructure is so good. You can get pretty much anywhere by train <em>(without Wifi)</em>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m riding through snowy fields atm. In a couple of minutes, I&rsquo;ll be back in a large city. Two minutes after that? You guessed it! Fields again.</p>

<p>Turns out, if you leave arable land around cities, they can feed themselves. Moreover, everything arrives fresh and with a minimal footprint. Ridiculous, I know.</p>

    <p>Not going to make it out of the airport from the looks of it. Spent too much time trying to get my phone and card working, and moving through security is non-trivial.</p>

<p>A new incarnation of a blog, a vacation in Europe, a sea-change in work and life upon return: this post is the herald of all of these things.</p>

<h2 id="the-blog">The blog</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing an increasing amount on paper, so let&rsquo;s do the Interwebs too! Do I have anything groundbreaking to say? Almost certainly not, but maybe some of you can learn from my struggles be they human or technical in nature.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect">What to expect</h3>

<p>Yeah, so&hellip;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to hold myself to any goals here. I find that makes me more likely to table-flip and return to my (farcical) quest for domination in the <a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com">League</a>.</p>

<p>Content-wise, it&rsquo;s probably going to be a bunch of links, photos, and laughable attempts at side projects. Maybe I write about a new album I love, maybe I weigh in on legislative concerns, or maybe it&rsquo;s all cat gifs all the time. Who can really say.</p>

<h2 id="europe">Europe</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m writing this whilst on a plane racing towards a layover in London that will (presumably) be rewarded with a flight to Stuttgart. That&rsquo;s <em>about</em> all I know. I fly to NYC from Stuttgart by way of London on the 1st of February. There&rsquo;s a conference in Amsterdam somewhere in there. All very hazy. Lodging has been secured for a couple of days once I&rsquo;m on the ground in Germany, but whim will dictate the rest. You get to follow along with me as that happens. Lucky you! ^^</p>

<p>I can assure you of pictures between now and February 9th. Some of food. Some of architecture. God willing, most of beer.</p>

<h2 id="oh-life">Oh, life&hellip;</h2>

<p>When I get back home, I&rsquo;ll have a new boss, a new primary focus at work, and limited time to find a new place to live sans-roommate-and-canine-companion. I can&rsquo;t imagine that being devoid of things to write about or at least more pictures of booze.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also going to jump back onto the keto bandwagon. I&rsquo;ll cordon that stuff off from the main page, but if you want to follow along, there will be a category filled will  overwrought prose on the finer points of bacon weaving. This may make you a better person. It will certainly endear you to a large portion of my (alleged) audience. Maybe a My Drunk Kitchen clone is in order; though, that way leads ruin. TBD</p>
