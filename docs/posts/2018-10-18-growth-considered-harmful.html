        <p>More often than any other factor, headcount growth kills companies.</p>
<p>The assumption of the status quo: Groups of people have advantage over individuals because they can do more work with better insights and fewer failures.</p>
<p>There are a ton of assumptions baked into this supposition. - Everyone is working to a common goal. - All individuals have input. - Disagreements are raised and resolved to the benefit of the goal. - Folks aren’t blocking each other’s work.</p>
<p>These assumptions ring less-and-less true as a group grows. We’re not wired to have the trust needed to fulfill them at scale. We can subscribe to a rule of law which forces them to be true, but we balk at those strictures—critique of <em>Holacracy</em> and Bridgewater’s <em>Radical Transparency</em> makes that abundantly clear.</p>
<p>Rather than trying to solve the problem, let’s <a href="https://squiretothegiants.wordpress.com/2016/06/16/so-you-think-youve-got-a-problem/">dissolve</a> it instead. Let’s not try to tightly align massive groups of people.</p>
<h3 id="option-1-stay-small.">Option 1: Stay small.</h3>
<p>If we can’t get the scaling we want out of a large group of people, what do we gain by having it? I’d argue, a headache.</p>
<p>Take a cold, hard think about what your <em>needs</em> are. Are you covering up problems with more bodies? Why are you doing the work you’re doing today? Can you drop some, most, or all of it?</p>
<h3 id="option-2-allow-a-huge-degree-of-autonomy-around-a-vision.">Option 2: Allow a huge degree of autonomy around a vision.</h3>
<p>Ok, you’ve got a big, nasty problem. It’s completely inconceivable that you’re get traction with a small group, cool.</p>
<p>Are you treating loosely coupled problems as a tightly coupled one? Could you design interfaces between your problems and let their insides be black boxes labled <em>Magic</em> ? There are certainly problems that can’t be solved this way, but I find that those are usually the ones which are sociological in nature. IE) Caused by overly large groups of people.</p>
<h3 id="option-n-insert-option-here">Option n: <code>&lt;Insert Option Here&gt;</code></h3>
<p>Obviously this isn’t an exhaustative list or a true dichotomy. I write down these two because they’re the path I rarely see travelled. Companies like Basecamp and Haier are showing how much can be done pursuing alternate strategies. I hope that we take their lessons to heart. Just because something is <em>normal</em> doesn’t mean it’s <em>right</em>. Solutions need to be fitted to their context. Design can dissolve problems or completely prevent their formation.</p>
<p>Everything is a trade-off because nothing stands in isolation. We need to acknowledge the rich, unpredictable ecosystems that are our socio-technical workplaces. Often that means giving up the illusion of control.</p>
